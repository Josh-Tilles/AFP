    <h2>Change</h2>
    <p>
    The Archive of Formal Proofs is an online resource and therefore
    more dynamic than a normal scientific journal. Existing entries
    can and do evolve and can also be updated significantly by their
    authors.
    </p>
    <p>
    This conflicts with the purpose of archiving and preserving
    entries as they have been submitted and with the purpose of 
    providing a clear and simple interface to readers.
    </p>
    <p>
    The AFP deals with this by synchronizing such updates with
    Isabelle releases:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    The entries released and visible on the main site are always
    working with the most recent stable Isabelle version and do not
    change.
    </li>
    <li>
    In the background, the archive maintainers evolve all entries to
    be up to date with the current Isabelle development
    version. Authors can contribute changes to this version which is
    available over <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/afp/develop">sourceforge
    mercurial</a> or as tar.gz package on the <a
    href="download.shtml">download page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    When a new Isabelle version is released, the above mentioned
    development version of AFP is frozen and turns into the main
    version displayed on the front page. Older versions (including the
    original submission) of all entries are archived and remain
    accessible.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>If you are an author</h2>

    <p>
    The above means that if you are an author and would like to
    provide a new, better version of your AFP entry, you can do so.
    </p>
    <p>
    To achieve this, you should base your changes on the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/afp/develop">mercurial 
    development version</a>
    of your AFP entry and test it against the current <a
    href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de/devel/">Isabelle development
    version</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you would like to get write access to your entry in the 
    mercurial repository or if you need
    assistance, please contact the <a href="about.shtml#editors">editors</a>.
