<h2>How the Archive Works</h2>

<p>
Submission by email to afp-submit@in.tum.de
which is distributed to the archive committee (currently GK, TN and LCP). One member will assume responsibility. This includes refereeing
the submission, communicating with the authors, and installing it in the
archive. Once it has been installed, it will be announced on isabelle-users.
</p>

<b>Contents of submission:</b>
<ol>
<li>Title, authors, abstract, keywords in plain text (maybe html).</li>
<li>A short name, will become the directory name.</li>
<li>URL or email address of author to display on the web page</li>
<li>A tar file with the theory files, IsaMakefile,
    ROOT.ML and README or document/.
   The theories should work with the current release.</li>
<li>A notice whether submission is LGPL</li>
</ol>

<b>Submission procedure:</b>
<ol>
<li>Referee for content and form</li>
<li>Check if submission works with current released version of Isabelle.</li>
<li>Make sure submitter agrees to BSD or LGPL and potentially maintenance.</li>
<li>Check submission into repository (as release and development,
   we do this, not the submitters)</li>
<li>Make available on web page</li>
<li>Give out maintenance access to submitter on development version</li>
<li>Announce on isabelle-users</li>
</ol>

<p><b>The archive:</b> Will initially contain an unstructured collection of
submissions. For each submission there is a page with title, authors,
abstract, keywords, tar.file, and link to the generated html-files for
browsing. If it takes off, we can have fun imposing some structure on
it. But right from the beginning it will be encouraged and possible to
build on other contributions in the archive. The current released
archive should work with the current released Isabelle version. For
later: older archive versions should remain accessible (but maybe not
on the main page).
</p>

<b>Roles:</b>
<ul>
  
<li>PC / archive admins (TN, GK, LCP, more)
<ul>
  <li>responsibility:refereeing and initial setup of submissions, releases</li>
  <li>access:everything</li>
</ul></li>
<li>submitters (everybody)
<ul>
  <li>responsibility: new submissions, become maintainer if accepted</li>
  <li>access: email only</li>
</ul></li>
<li>maintainters (former submitters, Isabelle team)
<ul>
  <li>responsibility: keep development branch up to date with Isabelle</li>
  <li>access: repository read/write</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>user (everybody)
  <ul>
  <li>responsibility: use archive</li>
  <li>access: download via web page,
              anonymous hg read only of devel version available</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Maintenance:</b> Usually only on development version of archive (in
mercurial default branch). Released version of existing submissions should be stable.
</p>

<p><b>Maintenance responsibility:</b> Mixed. Simple fixes by us, anything else
by the maintainer of the contribution. We would give the maintainers
advanced warning of a new release (after feature freeze) so they have
time to update their contributions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>there should be an automated build. Important libraries nightly,
  larger developments less often (weekly?). Maintainers should be able to
  opt in to get email when Isabelle developement version breaks archive
  development version.
</li>
<li>there should be a simple build script so we can test if something
  breaks when we change Isabelle (before we check in)</li>
</ul>

<b>Sync between Isabelle and archive:</b>
<ul>
<li>there is a current release version of the archive (eg. for
  Isabelle2003, it lives from release of Isabelle2003 until
  Isabelle2004)
</li>
<li>the current release version of the archive will be updated multiple
  times in its live: for each submission and each time a maintainer
  fixes a broken submission (broken e.g. because they did not make the
  Isabelle release deadline). 
</li>
<li>submissions that do not work at release time are dropped from the
  archive (only temporarily until fixed, but things that don't work are
  never visible on the web page).
</li>
<li>there is a development version of the archive that is not visible on the
web (or only in the form of a development snapshot). It is in the repository
and this is where the maintainers work. It becomes the release version when a
new Isabelle version is released. How closely it is in sync with the Isabelle
development version is the choice of each maintainer in a spectrum from very
loose (only fix archive submission after Isabelle feature freeze) to very
close (always fix archive submission after each Isabelle change). Very close
should be the case for widely used base libraries, very loose is ok for
standalone developments. 
</li></ul>
