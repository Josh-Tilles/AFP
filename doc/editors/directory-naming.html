<b>Problem: naming submissions, have name hierarchy? which?</b>
<ul>
<li>flat name space without policy will lead to clashes over time</li>
<li>submission names are direcory names which are inflexible in CVS (no renaming/moving of dirs). If we decide on a hierarchy now, we haveto stick with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Hierarchy/policy options:</b>
<ul>
<li>encode hierarachy in subdirectory or long dir name? (/a/b vs /a-b/)</li>
<li>what to use as classifier? (name, author, volume, year, ...?)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Examples:</b>
<ul>
<li>name only: /Algebra</li>
<li>subdirectory per year / name only: /2003/Algebra</li>
<li>subdirectory per "volume": /1/Algebra</li>
<li>subdirectory per author/ name: /Klein/Algebra</li>
<li>name + author + year: /Algebra-GK04</li>
</ul>
<b>Decision:</b>
<ul>
<li>have flat namespace in CVS (we don't know yet what hierarchy will be good in 2 years time, and we don't want deep hierarchy without content)</li>
<li>submission-year based CVS structure might confuse people (might get mixed up with archive release years)</li>
<li>have chronological order on web page</li>
<li>have policy of reasonable, not too general names (not Algebra, but Ring)</li>
<li>in case of conflict (new submitter wants an existing name):
  <ul>
  <li>try to resolve by suggesting another reasonable name</li>
  <li>if that fails append author/year or similar</li>
</ul>
</ul>
