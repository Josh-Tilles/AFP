section {* Abstract *}

text {* The following document presents a proof of Cauchy's Mean
theorem formalised in the Isabelle/Isar theorem proving system.

{\em Theorem}: For any collection of positive real numbers the
geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. In
mathematical terms: $$\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \dots x_n} \leq \frac{x_1 +
\dots + x_n}{n}$$ We will use the term {\em mean} to denote the
arithmetic mean and {\em gmean} to denote the geometric mean.

{\em Informal Proof}:

This proof is based on the proof presented in [1]. First we need an
auxillary lemma (the proof of which is presented formally below) that
states:

Given two pairs of numbers of equal sum, the pair with the greater
product is the pair with the least difference. Using this lemma we now
present the proof -

Given any collection $C$ of positive numbers with mean $M$ and product
$P$ and with some element not equal to M we can choose two elements
from the collection, $a$ and $b$ where $a>M$ and $b<M$. Remove these
elements from the collection and replace them with two new elements,
$a'$ and $b'$ such that $a' = M$ and $a' + b' = a + b$. This new
collection $C'$ now has a greater product $P'$ but equal mean with
respect to $C$. We can continue in this fashion until we have a
collection $C_n$ such that $P_n > P$ and $M_n = M$, but $C_n$ has all
its elements equal to $M$ and thus $P_n = M^n$. Using the definition
of geometric and arithmetic means above we can see that for any
collection of positive elements $E$ it is always true that gmean E
$\leq$ mean E. QED.
