text {* Reasoning about loops in pGCL is mostly familiar, in particular in the use of invariants.
Proving termination for truly probabilistic loops is slightly different: We appeal to a 0--1 law
to show that the loop terminates \emph{with probability 1}.  In our semantic model, terminating
with certainty and with probability 1 are exactly equivalent. *}

subsection {* Guaranteed Termination *}

text {* We start with a completely classical loop, to show that standard techniques apply. Here, we
have a program that simply decrements a counter until it hits zero: *}

definition countdown :: "int prog"
where
  "countdown = do (\<lambda>x. 0 < x) \<longrightarrow> Apply (\<lambda>s. s - 1) od"

text {* Clearly, this loop will only terminate from a state where @{term "0 \<le> x"}. This is, in fact,
also a loop invariant. *}

definition inv_count :: "int \<Rightarrow> bool"
where
  "inv_count = (\<lambda>x. 0 \<le> x)"

text {* Read @{term "wp_inv G body I"} as: @{term I} is an invariant of the loop
@{term "do G \<longrightarrow> body od"}, or @{term "\<guillemotleft>G\<guillemotright> && I \<tturnstile> wp body I"}. *}

    here, as if @{term "x \<le> 0"}, the measure will \emph{not} decrease.
