section "Online Algorithm Move-to-Front"

text{* It was first proved by Sleator and Tarjan~\cite{SleatorT-CACM85} that
the Move-to-Front algorithm is 2-competitive. *}

(* The core idea, not used: *)
lemma sum_telescope:
fixes f :: "nat \<Rightarrow> 'a::linordered_ab_group_add"
shows "(\<Sum>i=0..<k. f(Suc i) - f i) = f k - f 0"
by(induction k) auto

(* The version with upper bounds, used: *)
lemma potential:
fixes t :: "nat \<Rightarrow> 'a::linordered_ab_group_add" and p :: "nat \<Rightarrow> 'a"
assumes p0: "p 0 = 0" and ppos: "\<And>n. p n \<ge> 0"
and ub: "\<And>n. t n + p(Suc n) - p n \<le> u n"
shows "(\<Sum>i<n. t i) \<le> (\<Sum>i<n. u i)"
proof-
  let ?a = "\<lambda>n. t n + p(Suc n) - p n"
  have 1: "(\<Sum>i<n. t i) = (\<Sum>i<n. ?a i) - p(n)"
