\title{Splay Tree}
\author{Tobias Nipkow}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Splay trees are self-adjusting binary search trees which were
invented by Sleator and Tarjan~\cite{SleatorT-JACM85}.
This entry provides executable and verified functional splay trees.

The amortized complexity of splay trees is analyzed in the AFP entry
\href{http://afp.sourceforge.net/entries/Amortized_Complexity.shtml}{Amortized Complexity}.
