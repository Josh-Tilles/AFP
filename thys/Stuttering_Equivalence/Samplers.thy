section {* Stuttering Sampling Functions *}

text {*
  Given an @{text \<omega>}-sequence @{text "\<sigma>"}, a stuttering sampling function 
  is a strictly monotonic function @{text "f::nat \<Rightarrow> nat"} such that
  @{text "f 0 = 0"} and for all @{text i} and all @{text "f i \<le> k < f (i+1)"},
  the elements @{text "\<sigma> k"} are the same. In other words, @{text f} skips some
  (but not necessarily all) stuttering steps, but never skips a non-stuttering step.
  Given such @{text "\<sigma>"} and @{text f}, the (stuttering-)sampled
  reduction of @{text "\<sigma>"} is the sequence of elements of @{text "\<sigma>"} at the
  indices @{text "f i"}, which can simply be written as @{text "\<sigma> \<circ> f"}.

  One can define a partial order on sampling functions for a given sequence

  if the reduced sequence induced by @{text f} can be further reduced to obtain
  the reduced sequence corresponding to @{text g}, i.e. if there exists a
  stuttering sampling function @{text h} for the reduced sequence @{text "\<sigma> \<circ> f"}
  such that @{text "\<sigma> \<circ> f \<circ> h = \<sigma> \<circ> g"}. (Note that @{text "f \<circ> h"} is indeed a stuttering
  sampling function for @{text "\<sigma>"}, by theorem @{text "stutter_sampler_comp"}.)
