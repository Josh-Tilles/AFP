header "An Example Submission"

theory Submission = Main:

text {*
  This is an example submission to the Archive of Formal Proof.

  The scope of the archive encompasses examples, textbook-style
  proofs, libraries and larger scientific developments.
*}

section "Format of a submission"

text {*
  Submission should be by email to \url{afp-submit@in.tum.de} and contain
  the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Title, authors, and abstract.
  The abstract should be in plain text or plain html (no images/styles).
  \item A short name that will become the directory name of the
  submission.
  \item The Isabelle theories: a tar.gz file with the theory files,
  ROOT.ML, and a README file or document directory. 
  The theories should work with the current release of Isabelle. 
  Each theory file should include a header comment like the one 
  in this theory.
  \item A statement that submission your is licenced under LGPL.
  \end{itemize}

  The submission of the example you are reading is at
  \url{insert-example-tar-gz-url}.

section "Proof styles"

text {*
  We accept proofs in \isakeyword{apply}-script style like the
  following.
*}

lemma true: "True" 
  apply blast
  done

text {*
  We encourage structured proofs with comments and
  explanations. The Isabelle document preparation tools support
  antiquotations like @{thm true}, normal {\LaTeX} commands and BibTeX
  citations. See \cite{LNCS2283} and the Isabelle documentation for
  more information.  
*}
lemma very_true: "True"
proof -
  -- "a very roundabout way"
  have "P \<longrightarrow> True" by blast
  -- "to show @{term True}"
  thus True by blast
qed

section "The anatomy of a submission"

text {*
  The directory structure of this example submission is the following  
\begin{verbatim}
Example-Submission/
    document/
        root.tex
        root.bib
    config
    IsaMakefile
    ROOT.ML
    README.html
    Submission.thy
\end{verbatim}

The document directory contains the {\LaTeX} master file
\texttt{root.tex} and the bibliography \texttt{root.bib}. Your
submission should contain this {\LaTeX} setup or a \texttt{README.html}
(or both) with title, abstract, author, and any further documentation
you whish to provide. We encourage {\LaTeX} style documentation over
\texttt{README.html}.

The file \texttt{config} contains maintenance information. This is
optional. If you do not submit one, we will create one for you.

The \texttt{IsaMakefile} tells the automated build scripts how to test
your Isabelle theories. For a usual setup you only need to copy the
version from this example and adjust the variable
\texttt{SESSION-NAME}. If you need support with this, please contact
us or ask on the \texttt{isabelle-users} mailing list.

\texttt{ROOT.ML} controls which theories should be loaded. If you have
one main theory that depends on all the others, you only need to
include this one. You can also use \texttt{ROOT.ML} to control the
order in which theories are read. If you would like to build on other
entries in the archive, which we enourage, you can use the
\texttt{add\_path} command in \texttt{ROOT.ML} to add the directory of
the other entry to the theory search path. See the \texttt{ROOT.ML} of
this submission for an example.

The file \texttt{Submission.thy} is the Isabelle theory containing
this text. A usual submission has more than one theory file. You can
devise your own subdirectory structure if you have more theories and
one directory becomes too crowded.
