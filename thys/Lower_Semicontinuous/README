This directory contains the formalization of lower semicontinuous functions and
their epigraphs. This uses the convex analysis found in
HOL-Multivivariate_Analysis. The archive contains also a version of infinite
real numbers which is planed to be merged with the version in HOL/Probability
and moved to HOL/Library.
