  This work formalizes Pratt's proof system as described in his article
  ``Every Prime has a Succinct Certificate''\cite{pratt1975certificate}.
  The proof system makes use of two types of predicates:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{Prime}(p)$: $p$ is a prime number
    \item $(p, a, x)$: @{text "\<forall>q \<in> prime_factors(x). [a^((p - 1) div q) \<noteq> 1] (mod p)"}
  \end{itemize}
  We represent these predicates with the following datatype:
*}

datatype_new pratt = Prime nat | Triple nat nat nat

text {*
  Pratt describes an inference system consisting of the axiom $(p, a, 1)$
  and the following inference rules:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item R1: If we know that $(p, a, x)$ and @{text "[a^((p - 1) div q) \<noteq> 1] (mod p)"} hold for some
              prime number $q$ we can conclude $(p, a, qx)$ from that.
  \item R2: If we know that $(p, a, p - 1)$ and  @{text "[a^(p - 1) = 1] (mod p)"} hold, we can
              infer $\text{Prime}(p)$.
  \end{itemize}
  Both rules follow from Lehmer's theorem as we will show later on.

  A list of predicates (i.e., values of type @{type pratt}) is a \emph{certificate}, if it is
  built according to the inference system described above. I.e., a list @{term "x # xs :: pratt list"}
  is a certificate if @{term "xs :: pratt list"} is a certificate and @{term "x :: pratt"} is
  either an axiom or all preconditions of @{term "x :: pratt"} occur in @{term "xs :: pratt list"}.

  We call a certificate @{term "xs :: pratt list"} a \emph{certificate for @{term p}},
  if @{term "Prime p"} occurs in @{term "xs :: pratt list"}.

  The function @{text valid_cert} checks whether a list is a certificate.

fun valid_cert :: "pratt list \<Rightarrow> bool" where
  "valid_cert [] = True"
| R2: "valid_cert (Prime p#xs) \<longleftrightarrow> 1 < p \<and> valid_cert xs
    \<and> (\<exists> a . [a^(p - 1) = 1] (mod p) \<and> Triple p a (p - 1) \<in> set xs)"

text {*
  We define a function @{term size_cert} to measure the size of a certificate, assuming
  a binary encoding of numbers. We will use this to show that there is a certificate for a
  prime number $p$ such that the size of the certificate is polynomially bounded in the size
  of the binary representation of $p$.

  "size_pratt (Prime p) = log 2 p" |
  "size_pratt (Triple p a x) = log 2 p + log 2 a + log 2 x"

fun size_cert :: "pratt list \<Rightarrow> real" where
  "size_cert [] = 0" |
  "size_cert (x # xs) = 1 + size_pratt x + size_cert xs"


section {* Soundness *}

text {*
  In Section \ref{sec:pratt} we introduced the predicates $\text{Prime}(p)$ and $(p, a, x)$.
  In this section we show that for a certificate every predicate occuring in this certificate
  holds. In particular, if $\text{Prime}(p)$ occurs in a certificate, $p$ is prime.

section {* Completeness *}

text {*
  In this section we show completeness of Pratt's proof system, i.e., we show that for
  every prime number $p$ there exists a certificate for $p$. We also give an upper
  bound for the size of a minimal certificate

  The prove we give is constructive. We assume that we have certificates for all prime
  factors of $p - 1$ and use these to build a certificate for $p$ from that. It is
  important to note that certificates can be concatenated.

  "build_fpc p a r [] = [Triple p a r]" |
  "build_fpc p a r (y # ys) = Triple p a r # build_fpc p a (r div y) ys"

text {*
  The function @{term build_fpc} helps us to construct a certificate for $p$ from
  the certificates for the prime factors of $p - 1$. Called as
  @{term "build_fpc p a (p - 1) qs"} where $@{term "qs"} = q_1 \ldots q_n$
  is prime decomposition of $p - 1$ such that $q_1 \cdot \dotsb \cdot q_n = @{term "p - 1 :: nat"}$,
  it returns the following list of predicates:
  \[
  (p,a,p-1), (p,a,\frac{p - 1}{q_1}), (p,a,\frac{p - 1}{q_1 q_2}), \ldots, (p,a,\frac{p-1}{q_1 \ldots q_n}) = (p,a,1)
  \]

  I.e., if there is an appropriate $a$ and and a certificate @{term rs} for all
  prime factors of $p$, then we can construct a certificate for $p$ as
  @{term [display] "Prime p # build_fpc p a (p - 1) qs @ rs"}

  We now recapitulate our results. A number $p$ is prime if and only if there
  is a certificate for $p$. Moreover, for a prime $p$ there always is a certificate
  whose size is polynomially bounded in the logarithm of $p$.

corollary pratt:
  "prime p \<longleftrightarrow> (\<exists>c. Prime p \<in> set c \<and> valid_cert c)"
  using pratt_complete' pratt_sound(1) by blast

corollary pratt_size:
  assumes "prime p"
  shows "\<exists>c. Prime p \<in> set c \<and> valid_cert c \<and> size_cert c \<le> (6 * log 2 p - 4) * (1 + 3 * log 2 p)"
proof -
  obtain c where c: "Prime p \<in> set c" "valid_cert c"
      and len: "length c \<le> 6*log 2 p - 4" and "(\<forall> x \<in> set c. size_pratt x \<le> 3 * log 2 p)"
    using pratt_complete' assms by blast
  hence "size_cert c \<le> length c * (1 + 3 * log 2 p)" by (simp add: size_pratt_le)
  also have "\<dots> \<le> (6*log 2 p - 4) * (1 + 3 * log 2 p)" using len by simp
  finally show ?thesis using c by blast
