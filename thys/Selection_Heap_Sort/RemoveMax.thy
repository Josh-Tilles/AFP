We have already said that we are going to formalize heap and selection
sort and to show connections between these two sorts.  However, one
can immediately notice that selection sort is using list and heap sort
is using heap during its work. It would be very difficult to show
equivalency between these two sorts if it is continued straightforward
and independently proved that they satisfy conditions of locale
\verb|Sort|. They work with different objects. Much better thing to do
is to stay on the abstract level and to add the new locale, one that
describes characteristics of both list and heap.

text{*
We wanted to emphasize that algorithms are same. Due to
the complexity of the implementation it usually happens that simple
properties are omitted, such as the connection between these two
sorting algorithms. This is a key feature that should be presented to
students in order to understand these algorithms. It is not unknown
that students usually prefer selection sort for its simplicity whereas
avoid heap sort for its complexity. However, if we can present them as
the algorithms that are same they may hesitate less in using the heap
sort. This is why the refinement is important. Using this technique we
were able to notice these characteristics. Separate verification would
not bring anything new. Being on the abstract level does not only
simplify the verifications, but also helps us to notice and to show
students important features. Even further, we can prove them formally
and completely justify our observation.

text{* As it is said before
in each iteration invariant condition must be satisfied, so the {\em
  inv l} is always true, e.g. before and after execution of any
function. This is also the reason why sort function must be defined as
partial. This function parameters stay the same in each step of
iteration -- list stays list, and heap stays heap. As we said before,
in Isabelle/HOL we can only define total function, but there is a
mechanism that enables total function to appear as partial one: *}
