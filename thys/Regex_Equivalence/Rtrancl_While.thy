text{* Computing the reflexive, transitive closure by iterating a successor
function. Stops when an element is found that dos not satisfy the test.

More refined (and hence more efficient) versions can be found in ITP 2011 paper
by Nipkow (the theories are in the AFP entry Flyspeck by Nipkow)
and the AFP article Executable Transitive Closures by Ren√© Thiemann. *}
