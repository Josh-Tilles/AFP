text{*
Define a type of ordered distinct lists, intended to represent sets.

The advantage of this representation is that it is isomorphic to the
set of finite sets. Conversely it requires the carrier type to be a
linear order.
*}

(*    
FIXME provide a bunch of invariant-preserving list operations too.

FIXME note this representation does not arise from a quotient on
lists. We need to consider only the sorted lists, which we could
quotient under membership. Starting with all lists we have junk
representations.

FIXME Based on Florian Haftmann's DList.thy and Nipkow's mergesort
proofs.
