subsection {* Sign changes of polynomial sequences *}

text {*
  For a given sequence of polynomials, this function computes the number of sign changes 
  of the sequence of polynomials evaluated at a given position $x$. A sign change is a 
  change from a negative value to a positive one or vice versa; zeros in the sequence are 
  ignored.

text {*
  The number of sign changes of a sequence distributes over a list in the sense that 
  the number of sign changes of a sequence $p_1, \ldots, p_i, \ldots, p_n$ at $x$ is the same 
  as the sum of the sign changes of the sequence $p_1, \ldots, p_i$ and $p_i, \ldots, p_n$ 
  as long as $p_i(x)\neq 0$.

subsection {* Definition of Sturm sequences locale *}

text {*
  We first define the notion of a ``Quasi-Sturm sequence'', which is a weakening of 
  a Sturm sequence that captures the properties that are fulfilled by a nonempty 
  suffix of a Sturm sequence:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The sequence is nonempty.
    \item The last polynomial does not change its sign.
    \item If the middle one of three adjacent polynomials has a root at $x$, the other 
          two have opposite and nonzero signs at $x$.
  \end{itemize}

      "\<And>x y. sgn (poly (last ps) x) = sgn (poly (last ps) y)"
  assumes ps_not_Nil[simp]: "ps \<noteq> []"
  assumes signs: "\<And>i x. \<lbrakk>i < length ps - 2; poly (ps ! (i+1)) x = 0\<rbrakk>
                     \<Longrightarrow> (poly (ps ! (i+2)) x) * (poly (ps ! i) x) < 0"


text {*
  Now we define a Sturm sequence $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ of a polynomial $p$ in the following way:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The sequence contains at least two elements.
    \item $p$ is the first polynomial, i.\,e. $p_1 = p$.
    \item At any root $x$ of $p$, $p_2$ and $p$ have opposite sign left of $x$ and 
          the same sign right of $x$ in some neighbourhood around $x$.
    \item The first two polynomials in the sequence have no common roots.
    \item If the middle one of three adjacent polynomials has a root at $x$, the other 
          two have opposite and nonzero signs at $x$.

subsection {* Constructing Sturm sequences *}

subsection {* The canonical Sturm sequence *}

text {*
  In this subsection, we will present the canonical Sturm sequence construction for
  a polynomial $p$ without multiple roots that is very similar to the Euclidean 
  algorithm:
  $$p_i = \begin{cases}
    p & \text{for}\ i = 1\\
    p' & \text{for}\ i = 2\\
    -p_{i-2}\ \text{mod}\ p_{i-1} & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}$$
  We break off the sequence at the first constant polynomial.

  This construction is obviously more expensive to compute than the one that \emph{first} 
  divides $p$ by $\text{gcd}(p,p')$ and \emph{then} applies the canonical construction.
  In this construction, we \emph{first} compute the canonical Sturm sequence of $p$ as if 
  it had no multiple roots and \emph{then} divide by the GCD.
  However, it can be seen quite easily that unless $x$ is a multiple root of $p$, 
  i.\,e. as long as $\text{gcd}(P,P')\neq 0$, the number of sign changes in a sequence of 
  polynomials does not actually change when we divide the polynomials by $\text{gcd}(p,p')$.\\
  There\-fore we can use the ca\-no\-ni\-cal Sturm se\-quence even in the non-square\-free 
  case as long as the borders of the interval we are interested in are not multiple roots 
  of the polynomial.
