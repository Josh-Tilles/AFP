subsection \<open>Example from \isafor/\ceta\<close>

text \<open>An argument filter is a mapping @{term \<pi>} from n-ary function symbols into 
lists of positions, i.e., where each position is between 0 and n-1. In \isafor,
(Isabelle's Formalization of Rewriting) and \ceta 
\cite{DBLP:conf/tphol/ThiemannS09}, the corresponding certifier for 
term rewriting related properties,
this is modelled as follows, where a partial argument filter in a map is extended to a full one 
by means of an default filter.\<close>
