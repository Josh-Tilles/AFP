section Introduction

text {*
  This theory provides executable algorithms for computing square-roots of numbers which
  are all based on the Babylonian method (which is also known as Heron's method or Newton's method).
  
  For integers / naturals / rationals precise algorithms are given, i.e., here $sqrt\ x$ delivers
  a list of all integers / naturals / rationals $y$ where $y^2 = x$. 
  To this end, the Babylonian method has been adapted by using integer-divisions.

  In addition to the precise algorithms, we also provide one approximation algorithm for 
  arbitrary linear ordered fields, where some number $y$ is computed such that
  @{term "abs(y^2 - x) < \<epsilon>"}.

  The major motivation for developing the precise algorithms was given by \ceta{} \cite{CeTA},
  a tool for certifiying termination proofs. Here, non-linear equations of the form
  $(a_1x_1 + \dots a_nx_n)^2 = p$ had to be solved over the integers, where $p$ is a concrete polynomial.
  For example, for the equation $(ax + by)^2 = 4x^2 - 12xy + 9y^2$ one easily figures out that
  $a^2 = 4, b^2 = 9$, and $ab = -6$, which results in a possible solution $a = \sqrt 4 = 2, b = - \sqrt 9 = -3$.

section {* The Babylonian method *}

text {*
The Babylonian method for computing $\sqrt n$ iteratively computes 
\[
x_{i+1} = \frac{\frac n{x_i} + x_i}2
\]
until $x_i^2 \approx n$. Note that if $x_0^2 \geq n$, then for all $i$ we have both
$x_i^2 \geq n$ and $x_i \geq x_{i+1}$. 
*}

section {* The Babylonian method using integer division *}
text {*
  First, the algorithm is developed for the non-negative integers.
  Here, the division operation $\frac xy$ is replaced by @{term "x div y = \<lfloor>of_int x / of_int y\<rfloor>"}.
  Note that replacing @{term "\<lfloor>of_int x / of_int y\<rfloor>"} by @{term "\<lceil>of_int x / of_int y\<rceil>"} would lead to non-termination
  in the following algorithm.

  We explicititly develop the algorithm on the integers and not on the naturals, as the calculations
  on the integers have been much easier. For example, $y - x + x = y$ on the integers, which would require
  the side-condition $y \geq x$ for the naturals. These conditions will make the reasoning much more tedious---as
  we have experienced in an earlier state of this development where everything was based on naturals.

For the main algorithm we use the auxiliary guard @{term "\<not> (x < (0 :: int) \<or> n < (0 :: int))"}  to ensure that we do not have to worry
  about negative numbers for the termination argument and during the soundness proof. Moreover, since the elements
  $x_0, x_1, x_2,\dots$ are monotone decreasing, we abort as soon as $x_i^2 \leq n$. *}

section {* Approximating square roots *}

text {*
  The difference to the previous algorithms is that now we abort, once the distance is below
  $\epsilon$. Moreover, here we use standard division and not integer division.

  We first provide the executable version without guard @{term "x > 0"} as partial function,
  and afterwards prove termination and soundness for a similar algorithm that is defined within the upcoming
locale.

text {* Termination essentially is a proof of convergence. Here, one complication is the fact
  that the limit is not always defined. E.g., if @{typ "'a"} is @{typ rat} then there is no
  square root of 2. Therefore, the error-rate $\frac x{\sqrt n} - 1$ is not expressible. 
  Instead we use the expression $\frac{x^2}n - 1$ as error-rate which
  does not require any square-root operation. *}
