\maketitle

\begin{abstract}

In this article we present a proof of the result known in Linear Algebra as the ``rank nullity Theorem'',
which states that, given any linear form $f$ from a finite dimensional vector space $V$ to a 
vector space $W$, then the dimension of $V$ is equal to the dimension of the kernel of $f$ (which is
a subspace of $V$) and the dimension of the range of $f$ (which is a subspace of $W$). The proof presented
here is based on the one given in~\cite{AX97}. It makes use of the HOL-Multivariate-Analysis session of Isabelle,
and of several of its results and definitions. As a corollary of the previous theorem, and taking advantage 
of the relationship between linear forms and matrices, we prove that, for every matrix $A$ (which has associated a
linear form between finite dimensional vector spaces), the sum of its null space 
and its column space (which is equal to the range of the linear form) is equal 
to the number of columns of $A$.
