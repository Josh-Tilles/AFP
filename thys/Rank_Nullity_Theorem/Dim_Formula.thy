text{*The following lemma states that every linear form is injective over the 
  elements which define the basis of the range of the linear form. 
  This property is applied later over the elements of an arbitrary 
  basis which are not in the basis of the nullifier or kernel set 
  (\emph{i.e.}, the candidates to be the basis of the range space 
  of the linear form).*}

text{*Thanks to this result, it can be concluded that the cardinal 
  of the elements of a basis which do not belong to the kernel 
  of a linear form @{term "f::'a => 'b"} is equal to the cardinal 
  of the set obtained when applying @{term "f::'a => 'b"} to such elements.*}

text{*The application of this lemma is not usually found in the pencil and paper 
  proofs of the ``rank nullity theorem'', but will be crucial to know that,
  being @{term "f::'a => 'b"} a linear form from a finite dimensional
  vector space @{term "V"} to a vector space @{term "V'"}, 
  and given a basis @{term "B::'a set"} of @{term "ker f"}, 
  when @{term "B"} is completed up to a basis of @{term "V::'a set"}
  with a set @{term "W::'a set"}, the cardinal of this set is
  equal to the cardinal of its range set:*}

subsection{*The proof*}

text{*Now the rank nullity theorem can be proved; given any linear form 
  @{term "f::'a => 'b"}, the sum of the dimensions of its kernel and 
  range subspaces is equal to the dimension of the source vector space.*}

text{*The statement of the ``rank nullity theorem for linear algebra'', as 
  well as its proof, follow the ones on~\cite{AX97}. The proof is the 
  traditional one found in the literature. The theorem is also named 
  ``fundamental theorem of linear algebra'' in some texts (for instance,
  in~\cite{GO10}).*}
