subsection{*The proof*}

text{*Now the rank nullity theorem can be proved; given any linear form 
  @{term "f::'a => 'b"}, the sum of the dimensions of its kernel and 
  range subspaces is equal to the dimension of the source vector space.*}

text{*It is relevant to note that the source vector space must be 
  finite-dimensional (this restriction is introduced by means of the 
  euclidean space type class), whereas the destination vector space may be 
  finite or infinite dimensional (and thus a real vector space is used); 
  this is the usual way the theorem is stated in the literature.*}

text{*The statement of the ``rank nullity theorem for linear algebra'', as 
  well as its proof, follow the ones on~\cite{AX97}. The proof is the 
  traditional one found in the literature. The theorem is also named 
  ``fundamental theorem of linear algebra'' in some texts (for instance,
  in~\cite{GO10}).*}
