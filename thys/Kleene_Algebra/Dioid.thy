subsection {* Join Semilattices *}

text {* Join semilattices can be axiomatised order-theoretically or
algebraically. A join semilattice (or upper semilattice) is either a
poset in which every pair of elements has a join (or least upper
bound), or a set endowed with an associative, commutative, idempotent
binary operation. It is well known that the order-theoretic definition
induces the algebraic one and vice versa. We start from the algebraic
axiomatisation because it is easily expandable to dioids, using
Isabelle's type class mechanism.

In Isabelle/HOL, a type class @{class semilattice_sup} is available.
Alas, we cannot use this type class because we need the symbol~@{text
"+"} for the join operation in the dioid expansion and subclass
proofs in Isabelle/HOL require the two type classes involved to have
the same fixed signature.

Using {\em add\_assoc} as a name for the first assumption in class
{\em join\_semilattice} would lead to name clashes: we will later
define classes that inherit from @{class semigroup_add}, which
provides its own assumption {\em add\_assoc}, and prove that these are
subclasses of {\em join\_semilattice}. Hence the primed name.

text {* The definition @{term "x \<le> y \<longleftrightarrow> x + y = y"} of the order is

We show some simple order-based properties of semilattices. The
first one states that every semilattice is a partial order. *}

subsection {* Near Semirings *}

text {* \emph{Near semirings} (also called seminearrings) are
generalisations of near rings to the semiring case. They have been
studied, for instance, in G.~Pilz's book~\cite{pilz83nearrings} on
near rings. According to his definition, a near semiring consists of
an additive and a multiplicative semigroup that interact via a single
distributivity law (left or right). The additive semigroup is not
required to be commutative. The definition is influenced by partial
transformation semigroups.

We only consider near semirings in which addition is commutative, and
in which the right distributivity law holds. We call such near
semirings \emph{abelian}. *}

subsection {* Variants of Dioids *}

text {* A \emph{near dioid} is an abelian near semiring in which
addition is idempotent. This generalises the notion of (additively)
idempotent semirings by dropping one distributivity law. Near dioids
are a starting point for process algebras.

By modelling variants of dioids as variants of semirings in which
addition is idempotent we follow the tradition of
Birkhoff~\cite{birkhoff67lattices}, but deviate from the definitions
in Gondran and Minoux's book~\cite{gondran10graphs}. *}

subsection {* Families of Nearsemirings with Additive Units *}

text {*
We now axiomatise an additive unit~$0$ for nearsemirings. The zero is
usually required to satisfy annihilation properties with respect to
multiplication. Due to applications we distinguish a zero which is
only a left annihilator from one that is also a right annihilator.
More briefly, we call zero either a left unit or a unit.

Semirings and dioids with a right zero only can be obtained from those
with a left unit by duality.
