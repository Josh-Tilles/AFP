\section{Introductory Remarks}

These theory files are only sparsely commented. Additional information
on the hierarchy of Kleene algebras and its formalisation in
Isabelle/HOL can be found in a tutorial
paper~\cite{fosterstruthweber11tutorial} or an overview
article~\cite{guttmannstruthweber11tarskikleene}. While these papers
focus on the automation of algebraic reasoning, the present
formalisation presents readable proofs whenever these are interesting
and instructive.

Expansions of the hierarchy to modal Kleene algebras and Hoare logics
as well as infinitary and higher-order Kleene
algebras~\cite{guttmannstruthweber11algmeth,armstrongstruth12hoka},
and an alternative hierarchy of regular algebras and Kleene
algebras~\cite{fosterstruth12regalg}---orthogonal to the present
one---have also been implemented. These are not covered by this
repository.
