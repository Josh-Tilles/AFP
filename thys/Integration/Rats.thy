(* The rational numbers as subset of the real type. 

by Stefan Richter, TUM 2002.

This theory should really be subsumed by the construction of the
rational numbers as part of the development of the reals in
Real/Rational.thy. Any volunteers? (TN) *)

theory Rats = Complex:


text{*A dense and countable subset of the @{text real} type was needed for
  some measurability proofs. That is why I developed this
  theory. Apparently, something similar exists in Isabelle2004 by now,
  but I have not checked it for applicability yet.

  To begin with, an injective function from $\mathbb{N}^2$ to
  $\mathbb{N}$ is defined\footnote{The function as well as the proofs
are derived from a german recursion theory textbook
  \cite[p.~85f]{Oberschelp1993}. Surjectivity is not needed here but
Larry Paulson suggested to prove it for completeness.}. Its inverse is
then a surjective
  mapping into $\mathbb{N}^2$. Another iteration yields three natural
  numbers, one for enumerator, denominator, and sign respectively. The
  rationals are now exactly the range of the resulting function on
  $\mathbb{N}$, which already proves 
  them countable, without even defining this concept. Much to my
delight, these functions could be reused for the simple
  function integral properties.*}

text {*The density proof was first to be adapted from a Mizar document

  Alas, it depends on a

  integers and reals. Fortunately, a much more
  elementary proof was discovered in ``Real Analysis'' by H.L. Royden
