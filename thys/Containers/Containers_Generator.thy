subsection Introduction

text {* 
  In the following, we provide generators for the major classes 
  of the container framework: \texttt{ceq}, \texttt{corder}, \texttt{cenum},
  \texttt{set-impl}, and \texttt{mapping-impl}. 

  In this file we provide some common infrastructure on the ML-level which will
  be used by the individual generators.
