text {*
This generator registers itself at the derive-manager for the classes @{class set_impl}.
Here, one can choose
the desired implementation via the parameter. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{instantiation type :: (type,\ldots,type) (rbt,dlist,collect,monad,choose) set-impl}
\end{itemize}

This generator can be used for arbitrary types, not just datatypes.
