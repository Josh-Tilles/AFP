subsection {* Generator for the @{class ceq}-class of the container framework *}

text {*
This generator registers itself at the derive-manager for the class @{class ceq}.
To be more precise, one can choose whether one wants to take equality as function
for @{term ceq} by not passing any parameter, 
or whether equality should not be supported by passing "no" as parameter. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{instantiation type :: (type,\ldots,type) ceq}
\item \texttt{instantiation type :: (type,\ldots,type) (no) ceq}
\end{itemize}

If the parameter "no" is not used, then the corresponding
@{term is_ceq}-theorem is also automatically generated and attributed with 
\texttt{[simp, code-post]}.

text {*
This generator can be used for arbitrary types, not just datatypes.
